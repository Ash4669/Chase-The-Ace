* To do
- Use Ionic framework to get the game onto mobile for the app store.
- create authentication page
- create database to use and look into how to connect that when hosting OR look at using a file which can be treated like a database. (will upload and run from the python imports so it is simpler.)
- create a chat feature with pusher to allow players to talk to each other
- do full database and have them sign in and store their wins at different games.
