* To do
- Create authentication page
- Create database to use and look into how to connect that when hosting OR look at using a file which can be treated like a database. (will upload and run from the python imports so it is simpler.)
- Create a chat feature with pusher to allow players to talk to each other
- Do full database and have them sign in and store their wins at different games.
- Look into Vue to simplify javascript code.


> To set up environment:
- Run ../Scripts/activate from chase_the_ace folder to activate virtual environment.
- Run $env:FLASK_APP="chase_the_ace" in atom inbuilt terminal or mac-terminal/ command-line equivalent.
