* To do
- Use Ionic framework to get the game onto mobile for the app store.
- create authentication page
- create database to use and look into how to connect that when hosting OR look at using a file which can be treated like a database. (will upload and run from the python imports so it is simpler.)
- create a chat feature with pusher to allow players to talk to each other
- do full database and have them sign in and store their wins at different games.

> Switching to python 3/ Setup

- pip3 install virtualenv
- set up virtual environment with "python3 -m virtualenv path_to_environment".
- pip3 install flask, flask_login and Flask-SQLAlchemy using "pip3 install 'module_name'".
- use "export FLASK_APP=project_folder_name" for mac, "set FLASK_APP=project_folder_name" for command line or "$env:FLASK_APP='foo'" for powershell. I believe this is correct.
